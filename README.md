# Naming Scheme

`Controller_*`, wher `*` is the part number. Please take special note that some components have variations of cathodes and anodes that can change the overall functionality. Some controllers may support both functionalities.

**WARNING**: These are simply controllers for components. They do not protect bad circuit designs that could damage your components. Please consult your components data sheets in order to ensure that your components are protected.
